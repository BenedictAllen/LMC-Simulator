# LMC Simulator

LMC (LittleManComputer) is a simplified model of a computer, providing a small instruction set of 11 instructions which you can use to write functional programs.

The commands are as follows:

* add
* sub
* sta
* lda
* bra
* brz
* brp
* inp
* out
* hlt
* dat

This is a small implementation of LMC featuring an easy to use GUI that allows you to see the program in action.
