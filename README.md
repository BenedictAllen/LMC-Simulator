LMC ([LittleManComputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer)) is a simplified model of a computer, providing a small instruction set of 11 instructions which you can use to write functional programs.

This is a small implementation of LMC featuring an easy to use GUI that allows you to see the program in action.
